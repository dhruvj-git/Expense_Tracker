# Personal Finance Tracker

## Project Overview

This is a Personal Finance Tracker application designed to help users manage their income, expenses, and budgets efficiently. The project involves creating a backend in Java connected to a PostgreSQL database, with future plans for data visualization using Power BI and a user-friendly frontend.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI (planned)
* **Version Control:** Git

## Current Progress (as of May 15, 2025)

* Database schema designed with tables for Users, Transactions, Categories, and Tags.
* PostgreSQL database setup completed locally.
* Java project created with packages for models and DAO layers.
* Implemented database connection utility for PostgreSQL using JDBC.
* Started implementing DAO classes for CRUD operations, focusing initially on the Transaction entity.
* Basic class structures with constructors and toString methods planned for all entities.

## Next Steps

* Complete model and DAO classes for all entities.
* Implement and test CRUD operations fully.
* Design and develop a console-based UI for initial testing and user interaction.
* Finalize database schema based on initial testing feedback.
* Begin planning frontend development and Power BI integration for visualization.
* Add detailed error handling and input validations.

## How to Run (once complete)

1. Set up PostgreSQL database with provided schema.
2. Configure database connection credentials in `DatabaseConnection.java`.
3. Build and run the Java application using your IDE or command line.
4. Interact with the console UI to add/view/manage financial data.
